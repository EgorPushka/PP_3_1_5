  <h2>PP 3.1.5 </h2>
</div>

This Spring Security project is a product of our learning journey at [Kata Academy](https://kata.academy/). It's a practical demonstration of Spring Security REST API combined with JavaScript/Bootstrap, allowing you to perform CRUD operations on a database.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <h3>Test Users</h3>
</div>
To explore the application's features, we have created two user profiles for you:

| --------------- | ------------------ |
| - **Username**: user | - **Username**: admin |
| - **Password**: user | - **Password**: admin |
| - **Roles**: USER    | - **Roles**: USER, ADMIN |

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <h3>Role-based Access Control</h3>
</div>

- **ROLE_USER**: Access to the user page only.
- **ROLE_ADMIN**: Access to all CRUD operations.
